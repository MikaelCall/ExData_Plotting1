# Exploratory Data Analysis - Project 1

This repository contains my solution of the first project in the
[Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) course exploratory data analysis.


## Contents

The following files have been added/modified compared to the provided
repository.

* **README.md** has been modified to describe my solution, and not the
project assignment.

* **ProjectInfo.md** is the previous version of `README.md`, i.e. the
description of the project assignment.

* **powerdata.R** is an R script to ease reading the required data.
* **plot1.R** is an R script to produce the plot `plot1.png`.
* **plot2.R** is an R script to produce the plot `plot2.png`.
* **plot3.R** is an R script to produce the plot `plot3.png`.
* **plot4.R** is an R script to produce the plot `plot4.png`.


## Instructions

1. Make sure the data is in your working directory.

2. Run the scripts `plot1.R` through `plot4.R` to produce the required
   plots `plot1.png` through `plot4.png`, e.g.
   <code>source("./plot1.R")</code> will produce `plot1.png` in your
   working directory.

## Making Plots

Our overall goal here is simply to examine how household energy usage
varies over a 2-day period in February, 2007. Your task is to
reconstruct the following plots below, all of which were constructed
using the base plotting system.

First you will need to fork and clone the following GitHub repository:
[https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1](https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1)


For each plot you should

* Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480
pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

* Name each of the plot files as `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, etc.

* Create a separate R code file (`plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, etc.) that
constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in `plot1.R` constructs
the `plot1.png` plot. Your code file **should include code for reading
the data** so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You should also
include the code that creates the PNG file.

* Add the PNG file and R code file to your git repository

When you are finished with the assignment, push your git repository to
GitHub so that the GitHub version of your repository is up to
date. There should be four PNG files and four R code files.


The four plots that you will need to construct are shown below. 


### Plot 1

### Plot 2

### Plot 3
